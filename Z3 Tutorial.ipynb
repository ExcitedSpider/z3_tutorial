    "# Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "## Hi, I'm Phil!\n",
    "\n",
    "I like math, computers, physics, and long walks on the beach. You can check out what I'm up to at https://www.philipzucker.com/ or give me a twoot at [@SandMouth](https://twitter.com/SandMouth)\n",
    "\n",
    "I work at Draper Labs where we use Z3 as a backend for tools like the Comparative Binary Analysis (CBAT) project https://github.com/draperlaboratory/cbat_tools which formally verifies binary program transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formal Methods \n",
    "\n",
    "What are formal methods? Well, let's google it:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"In computer science, specifically software engineering and hardware engineering, formal methods are a particular kind of mathematically based techniques for the specification, development and verification of software and hardware systems.[1] The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design.[2]\" - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, Formal Methods are the application of mathematical thinking to computational systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "More narrowly, Formal Methods make the connection between specifications and implementations rigid and reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A specification is a precise, clear, and succinct statement of what a program or system should do. It often has a logical or mathematical flavor.\n",
    "\n",
    "An implementation is also precise, but often significantly more verbose. It needs much more detail to actually describe how the system achieves it's goals. It often has a programming flavor. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two should be equivalent in some sense. The process of showing this is verification. This reduces the possibility of bugs in the implementation to bugs in the specification and in this sense a program can be proven correct.  \n",
    "\n",
    "How do we prove that other than by waving our hands and hoping? Well, it's pretty hard. One astonishingly powerful and versatile tool we'll explore today is the Z3 theorem prover.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Z3?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, let's google it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Z3 is a state-of-the art theorem prover from Microsoft Research. It can be used to check the satisfiability of logical formulas over one or more theories. Z3 offers a compelling match for software analysis and verification tools, since several common software constructs map directly into supported theories.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the heck does that mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of different interesting things you can do with Z3. It has some simplification capabilities that overlap with computer algebra systems like Mathematica, some capabilities that overlap with constraint satisfaction solvers like Minizinc, and a capability to manipulate and express logical statements. The sum total of these capabilities enables z3 to effectively and automatically find solutions to a wide variety of problems or (importantly!) effectively and automatically prove that such solutions _do not exist_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Z3 was designed with the intention that it is going to be used for hardware and software verification tasks.\n",
    "Many verification tools extensively use Z3 or equivalent solvers as the heavy lifting. They are often interfaces that translate the task at hand into a bunch of queries to Z3. But Z3 is also useful on it's own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Z3 was open sourced in the beginning of 2015. The source code is licensed under MIT License and hosted on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "Z3 has official bindings for C, C++, Python, .NET, OCaml, Java and often bindings available in other languages as well. It also has a command line interface that takes in a standardized logical formula input format called [smtlib](http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/). The python bindings are full featured, and python is a familiar language to many, so that is our choice today.\n",

    "# Interlude: A Rough Sketch of How Z3 works\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very useful to have at least a simplistic mental model of how a tool works, so that you can predict the places where it might run into difficulty, or formulate your problem in a way amenable to the solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Z3 (and other related SMT solvers) are built around the core concept of a SAT solver, so let's discuss that first.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SAT Solving\n",
    "\n",
    "A propositional logical formula is the combination of variables using the boolean connectives And, Or, Implies, and Not. Here is a popsitional formula over variables p, q, r, and w in mathematical notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (p \\lor q) \\land (q \\lor \\neg w) \\land (w \\lor r \\lor p) \\land (r \\lor \\neg w) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we assign values to the variables, we can evaluate the formula to determine if the whole thing evaulates to true or false. In this sense, formulas are like boolean circuits. Here for example, is a python function that evaluates a boolean formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def foo(p,q,r,w):\n",
    "    return (p or q) and (q or not w) and (w or r or p) and (r or not w)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One useful question we can ask about a propositional formula is if it is satisfiable. Satisfiable means there exists an assignment of the boolean variables to true and false values that makes the entire formula evaluate to true. For a circuit, this is deductively running it backwards to find an input, something that they are physically designed not to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specialized solvers for this question are called SAT solvers, one of which is at the core of z3. Here is a Z3 query that just sticks to the SAT segment of it's capaiblities.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "p,q,r,w = Bools(\"p q r w\")\n",
    "solve( And( [Or(p,q), Or(q, Not(w)), Or(w, r, p), Or(r, Not(w))  ] ))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a satisfying solution, it is quite easy and efficient to check if it is indeed a satisfying solution by merely plugging the solution. It is this property that puts the SAT problem into complexity class NP.\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, one can answer the SAT question by a brute force search (a giant nested set of `for` loops), enumerating every possible combination of true/false the variables can take on.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for every new variable we add the size of the space we are searching is multiplied by 2. Thus brute force becomes an unacceptable approach for a number of variables well below 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead SAT solvers search the space more carefully, trying to deduce and propagate information in a manner somewhat similar to how a human solves a Sudoku puzzle.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are surprising number of useful and interesting questions one can encode into this form to leverage the power of SAT solvers. One very natural application is hardware verification of logical circuits. It is often very useful to even _try_ to twist a problem into a SAT solvable form, because off the shelf solvers have become so good. SAT solvers have even been used to prove previously unproven mathematical conjectures. A revolution in the power of SAT solvers occurred in the 90s/00s where new techniques were found, some of the most prominent of which are backjumping, the two watched literal technique, conflict directed clause learning, and random restarts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## SMT solving\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two layers the SMT solver is working at. There may be complex boolean logical structure amenable to a pure SAT solver, but then there is also domain specific structure about the integers, reals, uninterpeted formulas, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can abstract all complex domain specific facts like the truth of $x + y \\ge 7$ as an opaque boolean variables $p$. We then use the technques of SAT solvers to find a satisfying assignment of these variables. But there are implicit constraints required by the actual interpretation of the boolean variables that may not have been apparent to just the SAT search. So we take the truth assignment and query a theory specific solver to see if that particular assignment is possible. If it is, we are done. If it is not, there is a reason it is not. We add this reason to our boolean formula and iterate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the intimidating name Satisfiability Modulo Theories comes from. The solver is solving SAT problems, but only accepting solutions that also make sense in underlying domain specific theories (\"modulo-ing\" those solutions out).\n",
    "\n",
    "In actual SMT solvers, there is no reason to not use domain specific information much earlier than after a full boolean assignment. The only objective is to do things that are logically correct and as fast as possible. The SAT solving and the domain specific querying may be very tightly interwoven.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is helpful to know these things so that you can have some intuition for what Z3 might like or not like. Z3 will likes conjunction (ANDs) formulas. Every disjunction (Or) tends to add branching behavior where Z3 has to pick which one it wants to be true. Z3 has built in procedures and understanding of\n",
    "\n",
    "- propositional logic via SAT solving\n",
    "- linear equations $3x+ 4y == 7$ \n",
    "- linear inequalities  $ 3x + 4y <= 7$\n",

    "- Uninterpeted Functions\n",
    "- polynomial equalities $x^2 + y^2 == 2$\n",

    "These pieces give a very powerful and surprisingly flexible base to work from. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What Z3 Can't Do\n",
    "\n",
    "Z3 seems incredibly powerful, and it is. However, you can express far more things to Z3 than it can solve. I've been cherry picking problems I know it handles well.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, factoring integers is at the heart of RSA cryptography. While Z3 can factor integers, it can't magically factor even moderately big numbers. "

    "## Verifying a neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are all the rage these days. One way of looking at neural networks is that they are a flexibly parametrized class of functions. What makes them useful is: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. They can be used at insane scale due to their simplicity and excellent available implementations.\n",
    "2. There are intuitive ways to input abstract structure and symmetry expected of a problem, for example translation symmetry, or a hierarchy of small scale pattern recognition combining into large scale strutures\n",
    "3. Inspirational analogies can be drawn from nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks made out of just relus (rectified linear units, relu(x) = max(0,x) ) and linear layers are particularly amenable to formal analysis. Regarding the weights as fixed, a neural network is a piecewise linear function and piecewise linear functions are among the functions most amenable to rigoruous anaysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most machine learning tasks don't have a mathematically precise specification. What is the mathematically precise definition of a picture of a horse? We could try to come up with something, but it would be rather suspect. \n",
    "\n",
    "The surprising power of neural networks has often been in areas where a mathematically precise rule based specification has not worked. Tasks that DO have a spec are questionable areas for machine learning techniques, because how can you know that the network meets the spec? Also, one would suspect such a problem would have exploitable structure such that you might be better off with a less general purpose approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there a a couple areas where one does have reasonable formal questions one might want to ask about a neural network:\n",
    "- Robustness around training examples and valdiation examples. Adversarial examples.\n",
    "- Control Systems - There are many control systems which we do have a reasonable formal spec one could write such as walking robots. These systems are so high dimensional that it is difficult to derive a good controller from the spec, and hence reinforcement learning may be a reasonable option\n",
    "- Neural networks as computational accelerators. There are problems which we know how to solve, but are very slow. It may be useful to presolve a large number of examples offline and train a neural network to give good estimates. Neural networks can be evaluated very quickly and easily thanks to modern frameworks.\n",
    "- Dead neuron pruning. Can we show that some neuron never fires over the domain of interest?\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll train a network to fit a simple 1-D function and then verify it's accuracy. This is of course a complete toy. How often do you see 1-D input space neural networks? Not often I bet.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it's nice for a couple reasons:\n",
    "1. Because we can visualize it. \n",
    "2. It drives home the point about neural nets being a space of piecewise linear function approximators, and how similar training is to curve fitting.\n",
    "3. It's simple enough that z3 can crush it. There is a big question if z3 or other formal methods can scale to modern neural nets. Modern top of the line neural nets are insanely huge. There are special purpose SMT solvers being built for this task. There are other approaches being pursued such as the use of mixed integer programming solvers. So this is an area of research. Come see tomorrow's talk for more!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of the capabilities of sympy and z3 give us access to some very intriguing possibilities. We're not going to investigate this in detail, but we are showing how you can convert a sympy derived polynomial into a python expression using `lambdify`, which can then be in turn used on z3 variables.\n",
    "Here we're picking a chebyshev polynomial as our base truth because chebyshev polynomials have some pleasant waviness to them\n",
