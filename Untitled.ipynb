    "There may be a very simple statement of what you desire a program to do. \"sort a list\" \"balance a tree\" \"never explode\" and then through a sequence of reasoning and expansion steps you write a program that achieves these goals. Along the way there are many assumptions like \"this counter never goes below 0\" \"this pointer is never null\" \"The 64 bit data at this memory location should be intepreted as a float\"\n",

    "Types are a fairly ubiquitous form of formal methods. There is a spectrum of sophistication of type systems. You'll see something at the far end of the spectrum this afternoon with Cody.\n",
